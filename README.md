# react-photo-slideshow  (This is a work in progress)
Created this React Photo Slideshow website with CodeSandbox follow tutorial from Carlos Baraza https://github.com/carlosbaraza/photoframe

It currently shows photos from my fantastic day at London Games Festival

Change the photos in the public folder to any of your own photos... You need to name your photo files as photo1.jpg, photo2.jpg etc... (currently there are 8 photos and NUMBER_PHOTOS constant in Slideshow.js is set to 8

Things still left to implement:

Pass paramter values using props so that NUMBER_PHOTOS can be set dynamically

Set the photo starting number dynamically

Random photo selection during the slideshow (instead of linear 1, 2, 3.....)

Add a caption for each photo
